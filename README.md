 # Transfer learning on a pre-trained model using Visual Geometry Group.
Transer Learning: Transfer learning is a research problem in machine learning that focuses on storing knowledge gained while solving one problem and applying it to a different but related problem. 

- first we have to create dataset.
- then  we are using Visual Geometry Group which will create model
- it will be adding layers and enhance the accuracy
- after creation of model, it will save and load it
- and after this we can use our model to  recognise the face.
